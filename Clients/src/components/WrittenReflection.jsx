                In the heart of Adum, where the red earth meets weathered walls, I came into this world. The year was 1989, and my mother's arms were the first sanctuary I knew.
                <br />
                <br />
                OTA 42 wasn't just an addressâ€”it was the beginning of everything. The morning light that streamed through those windows, the sound of my mother's laughter echoing through the rooms, the way she held me like I was her entire universe.
                <br />
                <br />
                Every corner of that house holds a memory, every wall a story. This is where love first found its voice, where dreams took root in red soil and grew toward the sky.

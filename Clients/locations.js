My mummy dey grow
But I still no blow enough to put her in her home I still no fit change the car she get from years ago
I still no fit take over all of her rent mpo
She still the work and oh
Naturally
She still be proud of me
She asks for money sometimes but
Her number one request still be grand kiddies Meanwhile I dey grind in these
streets
Struggling to pay my masters fees
My mummy dey grow
Ovi ne duku på plenty grey dey show
She dey stress climb stairs cos her knees dey go
BP dey rise and I have a need to show
fruits of the seeds she sow

brother and a wife to feed, wondering if this rich dad thing şef man fit be
My mummy dey grow,
Enso still a, me nyɛɛ hwee nmɑɑ no killa,
I mean by now wɔ sɛ nkɑ m'ɑmɑ no villa And like a 100 visa
Maids ne gardeners, paying for her drivers Last time I passed by the house where
I said
I was gonna buy her, when I grow up
Yeah I think the owner
Turned it into some apartments
And I still cant afford mummy a flat there
Funny I was on my way to carry mattress from mummy ein house when I by chance met
my homie from back then
Ose Cue my mummy she go
Maame yi brε a w'abrɛ me ho yi
M'antumi anma no bed sheet mpo

She used to cry when she threw food away

Now she no fit answer and
I feel so lonely out here
Hold yours cos you're lucky to have her
Made me feel terrible as a son,
I no dey call enough,
Blame it on these schemes adey run
These streets, no be fun
These gees, no fit come
My mummy dey grow
Nansa yi weekend biara maninii dey go
Wonder how she feels to know
That I still no be close
To paying her back and giving her what she want or
Four more
When you've taken plenty shots and still put nothing on the scoreboard
I Wonder who you disappoint more?
Your mummy or your wife?
Shit I might
have to tell y'all the story of my life.`}

 lost my sight

I'm driving blind when I'm with you

1 think I'm fell and hit my head in love
With you

With you, with you

Midoh!

Last one did me dirty

Na wo ye certi

From the day you text me

Had nothing to hide

Before na me lie

Eye shape ene size

Tapped into your mind

Saw all the divine designs

kae when you met me?

Wo se "l thought you were taller"

And then you led me

to your room for the vibes

Na Connection no y3 high wae

Touched all your hotspots

by week two Cue knew this was the wife 
Was made for

kept me really close

Real like IG videos

pity those who

Let you slip into my safe hands in pretty clothes boo
Now where should we go to?

Hwim

Next to the Eiffel Tower we made love
Swear a lot of my firsts you dey mong
Drove that white Corolla like a grey porsche
It's like time stopped when our song came on

Rising sun in the morning you light my world

Girl with you there's no dull

And | no fit make it a day

Without your love yeah

Hold me down, you dey hold me close

If e no be you my song no fit bounce

With just your love I'll shut the whole world down Qu ouhhh

You are, are

You are my true love yeah

You no go barb until you end up in the studio with your idol On a label that you always told your friends that you'll sign to Feeling like you made it to the finals Small time the blow up go dey find you The whole city behind you Remember winning, it's time to Spin em true tales to a classic mixtape Figure the label go have your back but then throw you to the sharks You be smart so you play the optics But the fact, is the cards, on the ground no be great for options Producers se nana ylsigne wo dee a tua yen beat ka| Efiefoo ate, omo refre for sika wo nnipa joe se he dey from day 1 No be this thing we pray for?
So how e set e no dey get the cake some? Make man, depressed he just, dey crib, dey stress 3 singles, no hit, radio no dey pick sef You turn entourage for EL I mean you're happy to be there Opening act on every stage But Nobody sef dey care Fans dey talk, say you flop and you're losing your groove Pappy drop, he on top for you nothing dey move You abusing the booze taking it out on your boo Mummy still dey call dey biz what you dey do
Cos I've been waiting long ain't getting this call And I be staying strong watching fellas dey ball But Baby Tm falling Baby Tm falling Falling

Successful, yet still, something is off
They make you drop a song that clashes with your spirit
It becomes your biggest ever joint leaving you livid
Your legacy cannot be those lyrics
So you start to pull away
Your partner sef no dey pull ein weight
Or so you say
You tell them free shows no dee m'awie
And you'll be going away
Label slows down the promo
You ain't popping no mo
You start slumping
This Could've been something but your ego was in the way

Dropped I no dey instead of Corolla and it was crickets And UftWj doesn't want me on that song for me to kill it BBnZ never calls, and the school I finish NSS at NMC my rap career withers Words end up on the page-s Of newspapers Or I end up on TV because of my face Ori research and I chase A Phd in English so I can end my days Somewhere in America as Dr. LK Associate professor and the world never Gets, The Shining, P&P, Up & Awake For My Brothers doesn't drop on that November day And the boy who dm'd me saying that I saved Him is consumed by his grief, and he makes His way up to a peak, jumps and falls to his grave What else in the world would've changed?`}
